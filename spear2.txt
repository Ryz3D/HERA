- Architecture -
interrupt support
  AND with irq enable flag, maybe override data flow from ROM to IR, force custom instructions
16bit (RAM and ROM addresses) -> all buses, all registers, literals!, RAM (two chips parallel for 16bit values, four chips for 16bit addresses)
two 8bit buses -> transfer word by default (both buses), read byte from only low bus
flags: negative, zero, carry
instructions all in one EEPROM. looks like: [INS] [LIT1] [LIT2]
length of an instruction is defined by "write to bus" bits -> zero means literal follows -> proper IR incl. literal
rotary switch -> predefined clock frequencies (0.25 Hz, 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 kHz, 2MHz -> 555 limit)

- Software -
intermediate language for large constructs (i.e. function, return, loop), all operations (annotation for keeping/restoring registers), better readability and generalised optimizations
  could be 6502 assembly
  could be interpreted written text ("jump based on carry bit")
  incl. 32bit constructs (add LSB, PC_C, add MSB)

- PCB -
SMD ICs, 74HC, maybe ACT (not 260, check availability)
SMD LEDs (bus, registers)
visible, parallel bus traces (separate high/low buses perhaps)
register: probably xx374, xx16374 does exist but seems expensive
bottom pins like compute module

- Details -
RAM:
0x00 zeropage (incl. special addresses, 0x00FF 16bit stack pointer)
0x01 default I (break out 8 decoded lines for simple input devices -> demultiplexer: 2 select bits, all remaining bits zero (NOR) as data input)
0x02 default O (break out 8 decoded lines for simple output devices -> demultiplexer: 2 select bits, all remaining bits zero (NOR) as data input)
general purpose outputs can be expanded by an external address decoder/selector at the expense of RAM size
